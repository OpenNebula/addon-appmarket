# AppMarket

## Description

AppMarket allows you to build your own internal marketplace service. Your OpenNebula users will be able to import the appliances from your internal AppMarket service to their OpenNebula instance through a new Sunstone tab called AppMarket; or specifying the Appliance URL in the Image template using the oneimage create command. 

After deploying the AppMarket server, users will be able to access the AppMarket functionality through its GUI, pointing the web browser to the url where the server is running; or through the CLI, using the appmarket* commands. 

The [OpenNebula Marketplace](http://marketplace.c12g.com/appliance) is an example of an AppMarket deployment currently running and publicly accessible for the OpenNebula community.
